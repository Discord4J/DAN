# DAN (Discord Audio Native)
**Discord Audio Native (DAN)** is a native implementation of the Discord UDP Socket for [Voice Connections](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections). It is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) to support multiple platforms and to ensure runtime safety. The [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) implementation is designed to be completely language and library agnostic.

**This library is currently extremely experimental!**
